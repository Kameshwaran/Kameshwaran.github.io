            My Experience with Git bisect
          </h3>

          <hr>
          
          <p>
            Before a try on git bisect, I didn't know how powerful git is. Git bisect is an amazing tool that i have ever gone through. After breaking my head manytimes for finding the bug in the current project, my friend told me to go through 'git bisect'.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When i started learning what it is, I did not impressed by it. I thought that this tool is not going to tell me where bug is exactly. Alter learning git bisect, I just started it in a halfminded mood.
          </p>

          <p>
            But when i was doing git bisect, i felt like playing some games, because it just prompted me the commits one by one and asked me whether it is good or bad. I tested and gave the result. My bug is figured out within 5 minutes. It is just a single line of code which caused the major problem. But i wasted around 5 or 6 hours before using git bisect. After working 1 year in a software company, finally i realized that, the bugs not always arises in the code, sometimes it arises in our mind too.
          </p>

          <p>
            I recommend that every programmer should learn git. Now i'm very eager to learn more about git. After working on git bisect, got some motivation say that "If we build a tool, that should be like git bisect, in terms of usage, efficiency and more." A very big salute to git for building such products!
