            My Experience with Git Bisect tool
          </h3>

          <p>
            Before knowing about git bisect, I didn't know how powerful git is. Git bisect is an amazing feature that i have ever gone through. After breaking my head manytimes for finding bugs in a project, my friend told me to go through 'git bisect'.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When i started learning what it is, I was not impressed by it. I thought, this a feature is not going to tell me where bug is exactly. After learning git bisect, I just started it in a halfminded mood.

          <p>
            But when i was trying git bisect, i felt like playing some games, because it just prompted me the commits one by one and asked me whether it is good or bad. I tested and confirmed the status of the commit. The bug which i was looking for figured out within 5 minutes. It is just a single line of code which caused the major problem. But i wasted around 5 or 6 hours before using git bisect. After working 1 year as a software developer, finally i realized that, the bugs not only arises in the code, sometimes it arises in our mind too.
          </p>

          <p>
            I recommend that every programmer should learn git. Now i'm very eager to learn more about git. After working on git bisect, I concluded that i must build a tool, which should be like git bisect, in terms of usage, efficiency and more.
